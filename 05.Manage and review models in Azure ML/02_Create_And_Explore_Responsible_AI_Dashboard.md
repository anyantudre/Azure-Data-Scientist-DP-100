## Create and explore the Responsible AI dashboard for a model in Azure Machine Learning

Explore model explanations, error analysis, counterfactuals, and causal analysis by creating a Responsible AI dashboard. You'll create and run the pipeline in Azure Machine Learning using the Python SDK v2 to generate the dashboard.

Learning objectives
In this module, you learn how to:

Understand Azure Machine Learning's built-in components for responsible AI.
Create a Responsible AI dashboard.
Explore a Responsible AI dashboard.


### Understand Responsible AI
As a data scientist, you may train a machine learning model to predict whether someone is able to pay back a loan, or whether a candidate is suitable for a job vacancy. As models are often used when making decisions, it's important that the models are unbiased and transparent.

Whatever you use a model for, you should consider the Responsible Artificial Intelligence (Responsible AI) principles. Depending on the use case, you may focus on specific principles. Nevertheless, it's a best practice to consider all principles to ensure you're addressing any issues the model may have.

Microsoft has listed five Responsible AI principles:

Fairness and inclusiveness: Models should treat everyone fairly and avoid different treatment for similar groups.
Reliability and safety: Models should be reliable, safe, and consistent. You want a model to operate as intended, handle unexpected situations well, and resist harmful manipulation.
Privacy and security: Be transparent about data collection, use, and storage, to empower individuals with control over their data. Treat data with care to ensure an individual's privacy.
Transparency: When models influence important decisions that affect people's lives, people need to understand how those decisions were made and how the model works.
Accountability: Take accountability for decisions that models may influence and maintain human control.
